The hurricane brought with it, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and over the course of the next 5 days, more than 52 inches of rain - topping the record for tropical cyclone rainfall in the US in the last 50 years. The extensive flooding in the Houston area caused an 82 deaths and displaced approximately 39,000 people. It has been estimated that Harvey will cost the US over $190B, making it the most expensive storm in history, and exceeding Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the New Orleans area in 2005, by over $30B.
Our initial strategy session was held on September 23, 2017 in Austin, TX in which we brought together industry leaders from disaster relief organizations, advertising executives, venture capitalists, technology experts, entrepreneurs and startup incubator experts, educators, community activists and thought leaders in diversity and inclusion. During this session we were able to clearly identify several high level areas of concern for the communities of Houston as well as key areas of focus / potential solutions that can make a big impact on the post-Harvey landscape through entrepreneurial deployment.
The goal of our next session will be to build upon the strategies identified in the first Impact Experience, to bring together a specific set of investors, foundations, entrepreneurs and community leaders from the affected areas, to co-create solutions that empower entrepreneurs and include their voice in the rebuilding of their communities.
We cordially invite participants from the initial strategy session, as well as new participants from the aforementioned sectors who are committed to seeing Houston rebuilt with an eye on equity, inclusion and sustainability. We hope you can join us!
Sincerely,

For those of you that don't know, this isn't your typical club party. Sure PYT's will be ""shaking their tailfeather"" and bottles will probably be popped but it's more than that. The goal is and has always been to connect like minded Houstonians in a sophisticated ratchet environment where you can make business connections, meet bae (it's happened more than once), or just simply see a room of professionals rapping to the Houston classics. Thus far, it hasn't let us down yet! 
This year, we're also doing something a little different. Many Houstonians were/ still are seriously affected by Hurricane Harvey. We will be donating a percentage of the profits from Bad Santa to cover the cost of college applications for those affected by Hurricane Harvey. Any and all additional donations and contributions greatly appreciated. 
To anyone who has attended in previous years or simply told a friend, Booker and Miles would like to say Thank You for making Bad Santa ""a thing"" and bringing us to the 6th Annual Bad Santa Holiday Affair. 
Look forward to seeing you there. Happy Holidays! "

38730820928,Winter WonderLand Gala 2017 hosted By TJ & Candace Ford ,300,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/winter-wonderland-gala-2017-hosted-by-tj-candace-ford-tickets-38730820928?aff=ebapi,False,"



On August 25, 2017 Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas and devastated many areas along the Gulf Coast. The storm and its aftermath resulted in the most severe, damaging, and costly natural and unnatural disasters in the nation's history. 
Many families were forced to evacuate to shelters, family member's homes, or temporary housing. Those families and many others had limited access to basic services and are still trying to rebuild since the storm passed and many may not, for months or years to come. My husband and I believe that helping those in our community is one of our first priorities and one we share within our family. Helping a family in need is always a meaningful experience, but helping a family during the holidays changes their entire experience, especially after going through a devastating experience of that magnitude. 
Our goal with our Winter Wonderland Christmas Gala is to help and provide a Christmas for families affected by the storm. This is more than an event but a community coming together to help each other. You can help us support these families at the Gala by purchasing a ticket and you can also make a monetary donation to the families who will be receipents at the Gala.  Sponsorship opportunites are available also. Please contact pbmevents2017@gmail.com with any questions.  This is surely an event you don't want to miss.
