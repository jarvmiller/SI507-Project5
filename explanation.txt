I am accessing the Eventbrite API and gathering:
- Events that are related to "Hurricane Harvey" and within 30 miles of downtown Houston
- Events with 'concert' as it's category that are within 20 miles of UM's central campus.

For each search result, I will store the following
- event name
- event capacity
- event url
- whether the event is free or not
- The first sentence of the description
- event url
