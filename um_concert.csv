Norma Gentile brings her voice, Tibetan bowls, and a few musical friends together during the pre-solstice Full Moon on Sunday afternoon, December 3 at 4pm. Candlelight creates an intimacy befitting the musical offerings, which include medieval chants of St. Hildegard and songs drawn through Norma from Spirit. These improvised songs are particularly potent for healing and transformation, as they arise out of the connection between Norma's guides (Archangel Michael, Mary and the Hathors) and your own guides and angels. Please feel free to bring your own meditation pillows and blankets if you wish to lie down or meditate. Plenty of regular chairs are provided as well!





I am joined by guest musicians!


Atmaram Chaitanya - harmonium & tambura


Nathan Corell - singing bowls

Livingston is the fourth child in a very musical family that includes Alex, James, Kate and Hugh. Livingston recorded his first release at age 18, and continues to create well crafted, introspective, and original songs that have earned him fans worldwide.

Livingston has never stopped performing since those early coffeehouse days, touring with major artists such as Linda Ronstadt, Jimmy Buffett and Jethro Tull, and he maintains a busy concert schedule of over 80 shows a year. He is a natural performer, peppering his shows with personal stories, anecdotes and ineffable warmth. His relaxed on-stage presence belies the depth of his musical knowledge, as fans might be treated to classic Gershwin or something from the best of Broadway.
Livingston is a full professor at Berklee College of Music, where he has taught a Stage Performance course since 1989. He teaches young artists invaluable lessons learned over the course of an extensive career on the road. The course is consistently voted the most popular at the College. His 2011 book, ""Stage Performance,"" offers those lessons to all who are interested in elevating their presentations to professional standards

Following the traditional processional hymn ""Once in royal David's city,"" with soaring boy soprano solo, the program will open with “What Sweeter Music,” John Rutter’s iconic and profound setting of the Robert Herrick poem. Another tradition of A Boychoir Christmas in recent years has been to feature an Alfred Burt Carol—those wonderful yearly compositions that the famed Ann Arbor composer initially sent out to friends and family which have since become beloved classic carols. This tradition continues in a new way,  as Abbie Betinis—grandniece of Alfred Burt and one of the new stars of the choral composition world—has revived the tradition of writing a yearly carol since 2001. The Boychoir will perform her 2013 carol, Carol of the Stranger.




Other feature pieces will include a haunting and beautiful arrangement of Lo, How a Rose E’er Blooming, with  guitar and flute, and Bob Chilcott's delightful modern carol The Sparrows’ Carol. The Young Men’s Ensemble will delight with a virtuosic, raucous new setting of “I Wonder As I Wander” by Kyle S. Haugen.
The audience is always invited to join the Boychoir in singing “Hark! the herald angels sing”and “O come, all ye faithful”, each featuring a soaring descant verse sure to get you in the spirit!
