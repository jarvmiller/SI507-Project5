38847645353,Meditation Concert of Chant in Candlelight,0,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/meditation-concert-of-chant-in-candlelight-tickets-38847645353?aff=ebapi,False,"
Norma Gentile brings her voice, Tibetan bowls, and a few musical friends together during the pre-solstice Full Moon on Sunday afternoon, December 3 at 4pm. Candlelight creates an intimacy befitting the musical offerings, which include medieval chants of St. Hildegard and songs drawn through Norma from Spirit. These improvised songs are particularly potent for healing and transformation, as they arise out of the connection between Norma's guides (Archangel Michael, Mary and the Hathors) and your own guides and angels. Please feel free to bring your own meditation pillows and blankets if you wish to lie down or meditate. Plenty of regular chairs are provided as well!





I am joined by guest musicians!


Atmaram Chaitanya - harmonium & tambura


Nathan Corell - singing bowls
