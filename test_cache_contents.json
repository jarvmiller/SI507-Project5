The extensive flooding in the Houston area caused an 82 deaths and\u00a0displaced approximately 39,000 people. It has been estimated that Harvey will cost the US over\u00a0$190B, making it the most expensive storm in history, and exceeding Hurricane Katrina, which\u00a0devastated the New Orleans area in 2005, by over $30B.\nOur initial strategy session was held on September 23, 2017 in Austin, TX in which we brought together\u00a0industry leaders from disaster relief organizations, advertising executives, venture capitalists, technology\u00a0experts, entrepreneurs and startup incubator experts, educators, community activists and thought leaders in\u00a0diversity and inclusion. During this session we were able to clearly identify several high level areas of concern\u00a0for the communities of Houston as well as key areas of focus / potential solutions that can make a big impact\u00a0on the post-Harvey landscape through entrepreneurial deployment.\nThe goal of our next session will be to build upon the strategies identified in the first Impact Experience, to\u00a0bring together a specific set of investors,\u00a0foundations, entrepreneurs and community leaders from the affected areas, to co-create solutions that\u00a0empower entrepreneurs and include their voice in the rebuilding of their communities.\nWe cordially invite participants from the initial strategy session, as well as new participants from the aforementioned sectors who are committed to seeing Houston rebuilt with an eye on equity, inclusion and sustainability.

The storm and its aftermath resulted in the most severe, damaging, and costly natural and unnatural disasters in the nation's history. \nMany families were forced to evacuate to shelters, family member's homes, or temporary housing. Those families and many others had limited access to basic services and are still trying to rebuild since the storm passed and many may not, for months or years to come. My husband and I believe that helping those in our community is one of our first priorities and one we share within our family. Helping a family in need is always a meaningful experience, but helping a family during the holidays changes their entire experience, especially after going through a devastating experience of that magnitude. \nOur goal with our Winter Wonderland Christmas Gala is to help and provide a Christmas for families affected by the storm. This is more than an event but a community coming together to help each other. You can help us support these families at the Gala by purchasing a ticket and you can also make a monetary donation to the families who will be receipents at the Gala. \u00a0Sponsorship opportunites are available also.
